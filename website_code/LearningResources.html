                    <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Library and Resource Centre</h1>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Library and Resource Centre and to use the facilities for the purpose of their course of study or College employment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated from other organisations: a fee is usually charged. Access to the Library and Resource Centre for study purposes may be made available to non-members by arrangement. Details are available in the External Services leaflet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Use of facilities implies acceptance of the Library and Resource Centre rules printed below. These are designed to protect the interests of all users and ensure the College operates efficiently and effectively. The rules apply in principle to all sites, including workstation rooms and site libraries, notwithstanding some variations in practice in site libraries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Admission to the Library and Resource Centre is conditional upon observation of the rules, and the staff are empowered to enforce them. Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Library and Resource Centre disciplinary action, including the withdrawal of access, and if appropriate, by invoking the Collegeâ€™s Regulations for Students or staff procedures.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Rules</h2>
